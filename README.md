# dns
The DNS services implement a simple authoritative only DNS server for hosting DNS records for a Direct messaging domain. It is intentionally tuned to handle only certain type of DNS records including CERT type records as defined by the DirectProfject [specification](http://wiki.directproject.org/w/images/e/e6/Applicability_Statement_for_Secure_Health_Transport_v1.2.pdf).

Full documentation can be found [here](https://directprojectjavari.github.io/dns/).
